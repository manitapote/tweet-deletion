Keep the current version of the paper in the `current` folder. When you submit,
archive the version by creating a folder with the timestamped submission, e.g.
`20200202_nature`. 

Start writing early. When starting the project, start writing down the basic
idea of the project as well as key references. As the project progresses, start
and revisit the method section as you plan & execute experiments. Once you have
some results, focus on method description, figures, and captions. Use
`supp.tex` to stash whatever that does not belong to the main manuscript.
